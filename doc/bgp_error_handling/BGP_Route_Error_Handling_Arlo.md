# About this Manual
This document provides information about how to handle the "route add failure in hardware" related errors in BGP in SONIC.
# Scope
This document describes the high level design of BGP route install error handling feature. Implementation for warm reboot and GR for BGP is out of scope for this feature. When route installation fails in hardware due to table full, BGP may retry again when some routes get deleted. This Retry mechanism in BGP for failed routes will not be implemented in this release.

# 1 Requirement Overview
 When BGP learns a prefix, it advertises the route to its peers and sends it to route table manager(Zebra). The routes are installed in kernel and sent to APP_DB via fpmsyncd. 
The Orchagent reads the route from APP_DB, creates new resources like nexthop or nexthop group Id and installs the route in ASIC_DB. The syncd triggers the appropriate SAI API and route is installed in hardware. The CRM manages the count of critical resources allocated by orchagent through SAI API.
Due to resource allocations failures in hardware, SAI API calls can fail and these failures should be notified to Zebra and BGP to withdraw failed routes from kernel and BGP peers.

## 1.1 Functional Requirements

 

 1. BGP should withdraw the routes from its peers which have failed to be installed in hardware.
 1. BGP should mark the routes which are not installed in hardware as  failed routes in its RIB-IN table.
 1. Zebra should mark the routes which are not successfully installed in hardware as failed routes.
 1. Zebra should withdraw the failed routes from kernel.

## 1.2 Configuration and Management Requirements
## 1.3 Scalability Requirements
## 1.4 Warm Boot Requirements
   There is no change needed in BGP warm reboot for supporting this feature.
# 2 Functionality
Refer to section 1

## 2.1 Target Deployment Use Cases

## 2.2 Functional Description
Refer to section 1.1

# 3 Design
## 3.1 Overview
fpmsyncd subscribes to the changes in the ERROR_ROUTE_TABLE entries. Whenever the error status in ERROR_ROUTE_TABLE is updated, fpmsyncd is notified. It then sends a message to Zebra's routing table to take appropriate action.
Zebra should lookup the route and mark it as not installed in hardware. It should create a route-netlink message to withdraw this state in kernel. Also, it sends message to the source protocol for the route (BGP). 
BGP marks the route as not installed in hardware and will withdraw the route from its peer. It should mark the route in RIB-IN as not installed in hardware and remove it from RIB-OUT list, if any. 
For ECMP case, BGP sends route with list of nexthops to Zebra for programming. In fpmsyncd, as per the route table schema, the route is received with a list of nexthops. If the nexthop group programming fails, it is treated as route add failure in BGP.
For ADD-PATH feature, if the route-add failure notification comes to BGP, it will not switch to route of next best rank.

## 3.2 DB Changes
There are no DB changes associated with this feature.
### 3.2.1 CONFIG DB
### 3.2.2 APP DB
### 3.2.3 STATE DB
### 3.2.4 ASIC DB
### 3.2.5 COUNTER DB

## 3.3 FRRouting Design
### 3.3.1 Zebra changes
Zebra, on receiving the message containing failed route notification, will withdraw the route from kernel. It will also mark the route with flag as "Not installed in hardware" and store the route. It will not send the next best route to fpmsyncd. At this stage, route is present in Zebra. It will also notify BGP of the route add failure.

### 3.3.2 BGP changes
When BGP learns a route, it immediately sends its best route to its peers without waiting for notification from the hardware. However, the route may or may not be successfully installed in hardware.  On receiving route add failed notification message, BGP will remove the route from RIB-OUT list and place in RIB-IN with a flag marking the route as not installed in hardware. It will also withdraw the route from its peers.
In case user wants to retry the installation of failed routes, he/she can issue the command in Zebra. The command will notify BGP. If BGP has the route with flag marked as not installed in hardware, it will remove the flag and send the route to its peers.

## 3.4 SwSS Design

### 3.4.1 fpmsyncd changes
A new class is added in fpmsyncd to subscribe to ERROR_ROUTE_TABLE present inside the ERROR_DB.  Subscription to this table is sufficient to handle the errors in route installation.
Currently, fpmsyncd has a TCP socket with Zebra listening on FPM_DEFAULT_PORT. This socket is used by Zebra to send route add/delete related messages to fpmsyncd. We will reuse the same socket to send information back to Zebra. 
fpmsyncd will convert the ERROR_ROUTE_TABLE entry to Zebra common header format and send the message. It will also send a delete route message to clean the route from APP_DB so that OrchAgent can process it. If processing this results in a further error, then fpmsyncd silently ignores this.

### 3.7.4 Debug Commands
In order to retry the installation of failed routes from Zebra, a clear command has been provided.  
  clear {ip | ipv6} route {not-installed | <prefix/mask>}
  ```
sonic# clear ip route 
  not-installed  not installed in hardware
sonic# clear ip route not-installed 
  <cr>        
  A.B.C.D/M   ipv4 prefix with mask
  X:X::X:X/M  ipv6 prefix with mask
```
The above command will send route add message for the failed route from Zebra to fpmsyncd. The same message is also sent to BGP so that BGP can advertise the route.
